    <b>Binance Savings Rebalancer</b>
    <br>
    A ðŸ¤– for transfers between Binance Savings for higher interest rates
</p>

Binance offers 3 types of savings accounts: *Flexible Savings* (deposit and redeem anytime), *Locked Savings* (flexible deposits, higher profits) and *Activities* (limited supply, higher demand).
Savings accounts are unpredictable: different projects for different coins for different durations for different interest rates. 

ðŸ¤– checks the Binance API for new financial products and moves coins from account balances into available Savings projects. If necessary, the ðŸ¤– redeems coins from *Flexible Savings* to invest the assets in possible *Locked Savings* or *Activities* with higher interest rates.

The priority of investments: Higher profit first! *Account Balances* â†’ *Activities* â†’ *Locked Savings* â†’ *Flexible Savings*
